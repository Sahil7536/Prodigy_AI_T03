# Implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. This task involves creating a statistical model that predicts the probability of a character or word based on the previous one(s).



Text generation is popular across the board and in every industry, especially for mobile, app, and data science. Even journalism uses text generation to aid writing processes.

You’ve probably encountered text generation technology in your day-to-day life. iMessage text completion, Google search, and Google’s Smart Compose on Gmail are just a few examples. These skills are valuable for any aspiring data scientist.

Today, we are going to build a text generator using Markov chains. This will be a character based model that takes the previous character of the chain and generates the next letter in the sequence.

By training our program with sample words, our text generator will learn common patterns in character order. The text generator will then apply these patterns to the input, an incomplete word, and output the character with the highest probability to complete that word.
